        Slimefun can be confusing at times. All those dusts and ingots that look
        the same... Crafting even the medium-tier items can get very difficult
        and time cosuming. That's where our special, carefully made resource
        pack comes into play. With custom textures for every single dust and
        ingot there is, crafting will never be easier! It is free for download.
