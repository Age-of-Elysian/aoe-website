        Slimefun can be confusing at times. All those dusts and ingots that look
        the same... Crafting even the medium-tier items can get very difficult
        and time cosuming, and may ruin your playing experience. That's where
        our special, carefully made resource pack comes into play. With custom
        textures for every single dust and ingot there is, crafting will never
        be easier! The texture pack is being actively updated and worked on by
        our staff. It is free for download, so go ahead and check it out.
