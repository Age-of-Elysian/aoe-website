        We have a highly social, active and friendly community on our Discord
        server. Even if you're not really into Minecraft or are just taking a
        break, feel free to join and spend some time with us! All your
        suggestions left there will be carefully evaluated by our staff team,
        and it is the number-one place to go if you have any server related
        issue, you will get a swift response. We also have a
        Minecraft-to-Discord integration bridge, so if you have have linked your
        MC and Discord accounts with the in-game, you can talk with the people
        on the server just by messaging in the #ingamechat channel.
