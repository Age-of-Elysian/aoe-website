    <h2>What is Dynmap?</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="text-justify">
    Dynmap is a plugin that creates a Google Maps-like map for your minecraft
    server, which can be viewed in a browser. Players and towns are visible on
    the map, and you can even chat using it. Your messages from the dynmap web
    chat will also be transfered to the discord #ingamechat channel. Dynmap is
    quite useful for exploration and for meeting up with other players. It"s
    also a great way of checking out towns or builds by using the isometric
    rendering mode.
